        <details>
            <summary>A list of languages I have used, as well as how I have used them so far. </summary><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Rust</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">My main language. I have created many things with Rust, including a basic bytecode
                    compiler and runtime for a custom scripting language, a bytebeat mini language, runner, and
                    visualiser (explained in the Bytebeat section), a specialised Vulkan-based renderer (with an
                    included system for VGA text mode-like graphics), an asynchronous communication application between
                    a web client and a Minecraft turtle, a basic factory game system, multiple half-finished
                    recreations of the game <em>Just Shapes and Beats</em>, a cellular automata Margolus ruleset
                    executor, an indexer and labeller for <em>Geometry Dash</em> music that is not regularly available,
                    an image pixel sorter, a reverse engineering framework, a joint web/game/chat server, a clickbot
                    audio synthesizer, a Windows implementation of `/dev/audio`, an image corruptor, an NES ROM
                    corruptor, a university grade calculator, and many more tiny or unfinished miscellaneous projects. </p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">C#</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">Miscellaneous projects, my main language before I learnt Rust. This is what I used
                    to create the first version of the data collection app for our high school robotics team, using
                    Xamarin (the Dart section will go into detail about this). I also used C# to create games, though
                    most were never truly finished. The unfinished games include a Celeste-inspired platformer where
                    platforms are only active when lit, and a recreation of Fruit Ninja. One small game I have finished
                    is a recreation of an excerpt of the final part of Limbo, a level in the game <em>Geometry
                        Dash</em>.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Dart</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I learned Dart for our high school robotics team, the year after the C#/Xamarim app
                    was created. As competitions restricted the use of wireless communication, I created a specialised
                    application using Dart and Flutter to track data for each match, serialising data into QR codes
                    which were scannable into a Google spreadsheet. This application replaced the paper-based approach
                    that the team had done in previous years, and massively enhanced the accuracy and ergonomics of the
                    collected data.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Python</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I most commonly use Python for extremely high-level purposes. For productive
                    use, I have used it in a university assignment to create data plots and perform calculations with
                    uncertainties, and for my work I have used it to automate what would've been a gruelling task:
                    downloading over one thousand articles in the form of web pages from an old information base,
                    updating their content to achieve a look fitted better for the company, and reuploading them to a
                    modernised hosting service. Not only did the program meet the requirements, I created a web page to
                    generate content to create a much more functional layout than what was possible in the editor, which
                    included a generator for a paragraph with an icon vertically centered next to it, as well as
                    flexible headers that expanded to fill the width of the article, forming a flexible layout, and as
                    it replaced PNG images, the size of the documents were massively cut down. I am roughly familiar with
                    many common Python libraries, like Beautiful Soup, matplotlib and numpy. </p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">These three are roped together due to their interlinkage; the only independent
                    usage I have of these languages is JavaScript, which I have used to modify behaviour in the game
                    <em>Mindustry</em>. Otherwise, all three have been a factor in developing my website. Front-end
                    development is not my strong suit, and I have never had any experience with frameworks like React,
                    Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc., as I prefer to create websites with raw HTML, CSS, and JS. Sass and
                    TypeScript are as far as I have gone regarding preprocessors. I have made a few creations, notably
                    small web pages created for work, as they can be shared between computers without the need for any
                    installation. I have also implemented affine transformations in JavaScript and have used them to
                    create many interesting things out of raw HTML elements, such as a spinning donut using only span
                    elements and the CSS `translate` property. Other than that, I have pretty basic experience.
                </p>

            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Latex & Typst</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I am familiar with both typesetting languages, and have used them for university
                    lab reports. The uses of these are much more specific to school, though I am working on an article
                    in Typst that debunks the common saying that computers cannot generate truly random numbers.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">C++</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I am very familiar with C++ and understand many concepts of the language, but I
                    oftentimes prefer other languages. My most fruitful creations using C++ are mostly wrappers over C
                    APIs, such as OpenGL. My other creations are mostly formatted like C, but using a few C++ features
                    to make development more ergonomic. Many projects end up being recreated in other languages, notably
                    Rust. I have created an application that uses OpenGL and Dear ImGui to create a simple vertex shader
                    editor for dataless point primitives.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">C</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I most commonly use C for bytebeat kernels, operating system development, or for
                    fiddling around with very low-level APIs, such as XLib, WinAPI, or the POSIX API. When these
                    projects grow from small experiments to sustained projects, more often than not they will turn into
                    C++ projects due to the comparative ease of abstraction.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">CUDA</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I usually use CUDA for graphical applications, such as Nonane, my program that uses
                    WinGDI and CUDA to iteratively apply various fun effects to the screen using a simple
                    double-buffering system. Since CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA processors however, I prefer to use
                    open-source APIs, such as Vulkan, which I am in the process of learning.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Lua</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I mostly use Lua for modding, most notably for Factorio mods. I haven't produced
                    anything worth much, but I have become familiar with the language. I have passively used Lua while
                    experimenting with turtles and computers in <em>ComputerCraft: Tweaked</em>and
                    <em>OpenComputers</em>, both of which are Minecraft mods that add Lua-based computers.
                </p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">TypeScript</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I have used TypeScript for a few small projects, including a program that allows
                    communication between Minecraft turtles (see the Lua section). It is also my preferred language when
                    developing websites, as I enjoy strong type systems.</p>
            </section><br>
            <section class="box">
                <h2 class="skillhead">Bytebeat</h2>
                <p class="skillbody">I have mentioned bytebeat multiple times, so I will describe it here. Bytebeat is
                    the generation of audio through pure functions instead of through more complex music production methods. I
                    have experimented with bytebeat formulas, but one script I am the most proud of (which, as with many bytebeat formulas,
                    contains <b>high volume</b>and <b>extremely coarse sounds</b>) can be found <a href="https://dollchan.net/bytebeat/#4AACAO0dtj7sOgzAMRefmK7wUJdSIODwCEvAjKN2K2qEvYODza5LSdqg8WNf35tiZ07ZEcb2PjzO00FsssUbS3HIkg1Q6FMN4ek6rK3YaNWZcoRf4nRRcGSYG/4UsWm9vIfGmMnSGGEwcS7+kl3PXESmIQC80OEiBjEIhZXnKWfgUm5KaplY88IeHV1rBHioHCXiZeQkHqFTADYOCI5PqQJJz3PP/cLrcfF7hqsyPJredE+nFukCxjPnwXg">here</a>.
                    While it is not a language itself, projects such as the SthephanShi's bytebeat editor and
                    imageboard, viznut's IBNIZ, and a couple of my own projects are centered around the production and visualisation of
                    bytebeat. </p>
